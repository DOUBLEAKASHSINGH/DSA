    * Recursion and Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI) in C++
    * This code demonstrates the use of recursion and PMI to solve problems.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Base: Prove F(0) or F(1) is true.
    * Inductive Hypothesis: Assume F(k) is true,
    * Inductive Step: Using Induction Hypothesis Prove F(k+1) is true.
